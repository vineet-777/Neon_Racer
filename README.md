# Neon Racer 3D

Neon Racer 3D is a retro-futuristic browser racing game built with Three.js and WebGL. Drift through an endless neon highway, switch lanes, dodge obstacles, and chase high scores in a glowing synth-wave world. The game runs fully in the browser with smooth keyboard and mobile touch controls.

I vibe-coded this entire project for fun and experimentation.
